# This Makefile created for Microsoft nmake utility.

# Generally, all that needs to be done to compile (once astrolog.h has been
# customized), is compile each source file, and link them together with the
# math library, and if applicable, the Microsoft C graphics library.
#
#If you have a 286 or higher processor, you can add /G2 to the line below.
#if you have a math coprocessor, you can add /FPi to the line below.

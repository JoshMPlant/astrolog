Astrolog 5.41F - changed version.

Here are described changes I have made in original version of Astrolog.
Changes follows here in chronological order. Some parts (like planet powers
calculations) are changed several times, so overview of changes, where
changes are devided between different areas, gives better picture, what's
made. To distinguish changed and original versions, changed versions has
additional letter at end. Last version is 5.41F.

Changes made in code:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30a

Actually here I moved all my previous changes from Astrolog 5.20k to new
original version 5.30. Most new switches are accessible in Windows version
through menus.

   * 1. In graphics wheel chart between house (sign) cusps and house
     numbers (sign icons) are added icons of dispositors.

   * 2. In graphics wheel charts is changed dashenness of aspects lines:
     now aspect line is solid if orb of real aspect is below 1/4 of maximum
     allowed orb for current aspect (not fixed 2 degree independent of
     allowed orbs). In case of narrow orbs about 2 degree original Astrolog
     shows all aspects with solid lines, changed one only exact aspects
     with orb below 0.5 degree.

   * 3. In comparison grid charts transit-natal (both text and graphics) is
     now used different planets restriction set for both input charts,
     second set is transiting planets restriction set (originally in this
     case was used for both charts one restriction set from first chart).

   * 4. Added alternative way to restrict stars. Originally if all stars
     are unrestricted, using of -U switch caused garbage of graphics wheel
     chart from aspect lines between all stars, also star orbs are fixed
     2.0 deg.

     In version 5.30a are added switches YU, YUo and YUa.
     -YUo <value> - SET aspect ORBS for stars (in degrees), default 1.2 deg
     -YU - switch on/off alternative star restrictions.
     -YUa <value> - number of aspects taked into account to unrestrict
     stars.
     For example:
     -YUa 1 - all stars not conjunct allowed objects are restricted,
     -YUa 2 - all stars not conjunct or not opposed allowed objects are
     restricted etc.
     Note, that switch -YU itself don't allow any stars, one can use -U
     switch independent of -YU. In Windows version these settings are
     available in menu "Chart Settings".
     Stars needs really very narrow orbs, about 1 deg or narrower, and in
     version 5.30a orb additions of objects aren't used for aspects with
     stars, because orb-addition may be in this case greater than orb
     itself.

     Here you can compare images of natal chart wheels in case of original
     and changed Astrolog (my own birth chart). Note, that in case of
     changed Astrolog 5.30a stars are allowed, but displayed are only
     stars, conjunct with some other allowed object.
     Difference of aspect lines is more clear in case of comparison chart
     natal-transit with 2.5 times narrower orbs - original and changed.
     Note, that in changed case is changed also info-border. (look point 11
     below).

   * 5. In case of comparison charts and parallel-antiparallel charts all
     orbs and orb-additions are temporarily decreased and restored after
     calculating of chart. In case of parallels-antiparallels also powers
     of aspects are decreased 4 times. Now no need to change aspect orbs in
     case of comparison or parallel-antiparrelel charts - they are
     automatically decreased.
     New switches -YOc <value> and -YOp <value> sets coefficients of
     temporary decreasing. For example:
     -YOc 2.0 - set for comparison charts 2 TIMES narrower orbs (default
     2.5)
     -YOp 5.0 - set for parallel-antiparallel charts 5 TIMES narrower orbs
     (default 6.0)
     To disallow this option enough to set both coefficient to 1.0. In
     Windows version these switches are available in menu "Aspect
     Settings".

   * 6. Changed aspect powers calculation. With -a and -a0 switches instead
     fixed powers of planets given in astrolog.dat file, powers calculated
     with -j switch are used (really, only positions part). In case of
     comparison charts for natal charts are used calculated planet powers,
     for transiting planets respective transiting powers from astrolog.dat,
     for progressed planets calculated planets powers. If compared two
     separate charts, calculated different powers for both charts are used.
     Changed are also power calculations with -T switch, now "-Tn" and "-rt
     infile now" gives same result.

   * 7. Planets powers calculations are overwritten.

     Changed calculation of position powers powers: Added decreasing of
     power, if planet is in falling or debilitating sign or house. In
     aspects powers sum calculations now is used position powers of
     planets, given in first column, instead fixed from astrolog.dat - now
     powers of aspects depends from planets positions.

     Astrolog routines gives possibility to include in powers calculations
     also addition of power, if planets are in reception. Now planet powers
     are calculated in separate routine used for both -a and -j switches.
     Taked into account are: ruling, exalting, fall and debilitating in
     sign and house, also RECEPTION for main planets. As earlier, planet
     give addition to rulers through sign and house, also house cusps give
     addition to sign rulers.

     MAIN CHANGE:
     Astrologers are using two definitions of house ruler:
     1) classical (natural ruler) - ruler of 1st house is Mars, ruler of
     2nd house is Venus etc.
     2) accidental (situative ruler) - ruler of house is planet, which
     rules sign where is house cusp.
     Contemporary astrologers uses mostly situative rulers, and natural
     rulers are used as auxiliary.
     Original astrolog uses in power calculations only natural rulers.
     In current version influence through houses are divided to two parts:
     1) 1/2 is given to natural rulers.
     2) 1/2 is given to situative rulers.

     To planets total powers are added powers of parallels and
     antiparallels. Orbs and orb additions are temporarily decreased (look
     point 6 above) and aspect-powers decreased 4 times (for parallel
     0.25).

   * 8. Changed -j -X graphics chart: situative rulers hierarchy is added,
     so now here is three hierarchy: sign dispositor, house natural
     dispositor and house situative dispositor. Here you can also compare
     outputs of original and changed versions of Astrolog.

   * 9. In standard text chart added column with planet ruling, exalt etc
     in house, corresponding to situative house ruler. So after house
     number in column Rul. is now two letters - first one corresponding
     natural ruler, second one corresponding situative ruler.

   * 10. Added animation of graphics secondary progressed charts:

          astrolog -i infile.in -pn -X and
          astrolog -i infile.in -p mm dd yy -X

   * 11. Changed info-border in graphics wheel charts. In case of
     progression chart are displayed natal data, and also time and Julian
     day, where chart is progressed. In case of comparison charts are
     displayed info of both charts and for second chart is marked which
     chart it is: comparison, transit or progressed. These data changes
     respectively in case of animation.

   * 12. Fixed bug, where applayng-separating of comparison charts natal -
     progressed and natal - transit was wrong. Now with -rt and -rp switch
     natal chart planets velocities are made zero, and -rt (or -rp) with -a
     switch give correct applay-separate aspects (like -T switch).

   * 13. By analogy with sign's powers calculations added house's powers
     calculation. (in DOS version switch -j0).

   * 14. In aspect configurations list (in dos version switch -g0) added
     "Mystic Rectangle". Aspect configuration list is now printed out also
     with aspect list (switch -a0). "Mystic Rectangle" is described in
     lesson by L. M. P. McPherson.

   * 15. Original Astrolog has ability to display positions of 177 Arabic
     Parts. But there aren't displayed aspects to other objects. In version
     5.30a is added possibility to show only Parts, which haves some
     aspects with other unrestricted objects, and to show these aspects.
     Orbs can be set by user.
     Here are added switches YPo, YPa and YPs.

     -YPo <value> - SET aspect ORBS for Arabic Parts (in degrees), default
     1.0 deg.

     -YPa <value> - number of aspects taked into account to display Parts.

     For example:
     -YPa 1 - all Parts not conjunct allowed objects aren't displayed.
     -YPa 2 - all Parts not conjunct or not opposed allowed objects aren't
     displayed etc.
     -YPa 0 - switch off this option, display like original version.

     -YPs <value> - number of aspects displayed for every Parts.

     For example:
     -YPs 1 - all conjunctions are displayed.
     -YPs 2 - all conjunctions and oppositions are displayed etc.
     -YPs 0 - switch off this option, display like original version.

     In Windows version these switches are available in menu "Chart
     Settings". Note, that these switches are independent, that means, in
     case of -YPa 0 -YPs 18 Astrolog 5.30a display all aspects of all
     Arabic Parts.
     Here you can look example of output with default settings.

   * 16. Added new graphics outputs:
     The idea was given by Theodore Natsinas the author of "Astro - Chart
     ", (1992) published by Compupress - Greece. Any comments or opinions
     about it can be mailed to: tednat@compulink.gr

        o Tension - harmonic chart. On graphics wheel chart instead of
          standard aspects distribution of tensions/harmonics are
          displayed. Over the Zodiac for every point is calculated sum of
          powers of all aspects to this point, oppositions and squares has
          negative influence, trines and sextiles positive (conjunctions
          aren't taken into account as neutral). Tension points are placed
          near center, harmonics near outside of wheel. Result is like some
          flower, where petals shows harmonic areas, intervals between
          petals shows tension areas. Ring in center shows neutral level.
          This chart can be reversed, and petals shows tension areas.

        o Aspectation chart. By analogy, for every point is calculated sum
          of all allowed aspects to this point, but now all influences are
          summarized with same sign. Now petals shows more aspected areas
          in a chart.
          Both charts can be rescaled.

        o Allowed are also analogous comparison charts. Here are two
          differences:
          a) In case of comparison charts orbs are temporarily decreased
          (look point 5 above), so "flower" can be with very sharp petals,
          but one can use -YOc switch to smooth picture. -YOc 1.5 seems
          enough.
          b) In different comparison charts different planet powers for
          outer planets ring are used: for comparison (-r0) planet powers
          are calculated (look point 7 above), for transit planets
          respective transit influences from astrolog.dat are used. Powers
          for inner planet ring are calculated like for natal. Here you can
          look such transit chart, where orbs are temporarily decreased 1.5
          times (switch -YOc 1.5 used).

        o New switches:

               -Xa 0 - switch off new graphics (also -X made it) -Xa 1 -
               display tension/harmonic chart, tensions inside.
               -Xa -1 - same chart, but reversed, tensions outside.
               -Xa 2 - display aspecting chart.
               -YXc <value> - rescale both charts, value between 0.2 and
               4.0, default 1.0.

          In Windows version these switches are available in menu "Chart
          Settings" in separate box.

        o Text output for such charts is added to standard influence output
          (-j). After every allowed object is printed four columns. First
          two columns shows respectively harmonics and tensions in point,
          where planet is placed. Third column (sum of first two) shows
          summary tensions/harmonics in point, where planet is placed,
          fourth one total aspectation of this point. Note, that these
          aren't planet powers but parameters of respective point on chart.
          In other words, third column correspond to -Xa and -XA switches,
          and fourth one correspond to -Xc switch.

   * 17. Corrected calculation of Alcabitius house cusps. Thanks to Per
     Dahlin (pdahlin@tripnet.se) who sent me definition of Alcabitius house
     cusps.

   * 18. Changed calculations of house cusps in Polar Zone. In some
     situations in Polar Zone (named by Per Dahlin "circumpolar
     situations") pairs ASC - DES must be reverted, because Zodiac is
     ascending in reverted direction. Discussion in alt.astrology shows,
     that exist two points of view to flipping also MC -IC:

          1) MC is defined as upper culmination, then MC - IC aren't
          flipped, but MC is under horizon.
          2) MC is defined as culmination above horizon and MC - IC are
          flipped.

     In most graphics wheel charts with reverted ASC, it' s placed to
     right. Then Zodiac and planets saves his placement.

     Because exists two points of view to flipping of MC in Polar Zone, in
     this version user can select, flip in circumpolar situation only Asc
     or both Asc and MC. This option is controlled by switch -YH (or _YH,
     =YH). Default setting is =YH (that means, flipped are both MC and
     Asc). If one want flip only Asc, best way is add to astrolog.dat line:

          _YH

     Because use of this switch is very rare, this switch isn't controlled
     under Windows menus.

   * 19. Added Uranian Proserpina. So Astrolog 5.30a has 9 Uranians instead
     original 8. Proserpina is Uranian #8, (obj. #40) and last Uranian
     Poseidon is obj. #41. Remember about corresponding changes in
     astrolog.dat. All info about Proserpina I have is available here.

   * 20. Added 25 fixed stars, listed here. Because added stars have
     apparent magnitude greater than 2.0, colors of star printout are
     changed. Stars brighter than (less than) magnitude 1.0, are red, with
     magnitude between 1.0 and 2.0 are orange, and stars with magnitudes
     greater than 2.0 are dark red. Star name "Orion" is changed to Alnilam
     (epsilon Orionis), because one of added stars Mintaka (delta Orionis)
     is another star from Orion's belt (see helpfile of Astrolog,
     description of switch -U)

   * 21. In Windows version increased (2 times) screen buffer, because some
     new text outputs doesn't go in old one.

   * 22. Added new feature. In original Astrolog user can customize
     rulership of a planet using switch -YJ. That mean, changed are data,
     where planet is argument and sign is value, and lot of planets can be
     marked as rulers of same sign. But this switch don't changes data,
     where sign is argument, planet is value, and here for every sign is
     only one planet marked as ruler. Graphics dispositor chart uses just
     these data and this chart is independent of switch -YJ.

     In version 5.30a is added new switch -Yr, which allow to change these
     data and set as ruler of sign any planet, even Uranian. As result, on
     graphics dispositor chart can be more than 10 fixed planets
     (originally Mercury and Venus rules two signs) but maximum 12, own
     planet for every sign.
     Using of switch:

          -Yr <sign> <object>

     Example below changes ruler of Virgo to Proserpina and ruler of Libra
     to Chiron.

          -Yr 6 40 -Yr 7 11

     Here you can look an example of such chart.

     This switch changes also data, where planet is argument, that mean, no
     need for additional switch -YJ <object> <sign> <old_value>. Such
     change of ruler of sign changes also results of planets powers
     calculations, because changed version of Astrolog uses dispositor data
     in power calculations.

     Using of this switch is probably very rare, so best way is put it to
     astrolog.dat file.

   * 23. Changed default color of Venus from green (Air) to yellow (Earth)
     because Venus is always connected with Taurus (Earth), but often as
     ruler of Libra is used some other planet (for example Chiron). If one
     likes more original color, it can be simply restored by adding of one
     line to astrolog.dat file:

          -YJ 4 7 2

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30b

Mostly cleanup of code, but also added some new things.

   * 24. In Windows version using of parallel-contraparallel aspects can be
     set very simply. But Transit To Transit and Transit To Natal Hits are
     calculated for normal aspects independent of setting of Parallel
     aspect switch. Only effect is changing of aspect names from
     conjunctions and Oppositions to Parallels and Contraparallels, but
     used are really normal aspects, also trines, squares etc. In original
     Astrolog searching of parallel and contraparallel hits is absent at
     all. Now this omissed part is added and is possible to search also
     Parallel and ContraParallel aspects like it was possible with normal
     aspects.

     I don't added any specific switch to DOS version, in DOS version such
     searches are possible by using of additional switch -ap, which
     switches to parallel aspects.

     Note, that I don't added also any new interpretation.

   * 25. Overwrited temporary decreasing of orbs in case of parallels and
     comparison charts which allowed to remove lot of unnecessary code.

   * 26. Fixed my omission in animation of progressed chart, which itself
     worked, but in cause of transit-transit and transit-natal searches and
     influences caused changes of chart data (in Windows version after
     repeat of search, data of first chart was changed).

   * 27. Fixed original Astrolog omission, where in case of -sr switch
     (equatorial coordinates instead ecliptical) coordinates of house cusps
     aren't transformed from ecliptics to equator, and planets itself was
     on equator, but was placed to ecliptical houses.

   * 28. All -Z switch (Horizon) charts must be independent from -sr
     switch, because image of visible sky relatively to local horizon must
     be independent of coordinate system we use for planets (equatorial,
     ecliptical or some other). In original Astrolog all outputs of -Z
     switches changes in case of additional switch -sr. All routines,
     connected with -Z switch, transforms first coordinates from ecliptic
     to equator and then from equator to local horizon coordinates. In case
     of -sr switch first transform from ecliptic to equator is superfluous,
     because in case of -sr switch coordinates are already given in
     equatorial system. In 5.30b this bug is fixed.

   * 29. Added new switch -Ze, where outputs are relatively to equator
     instead of local horizon. These outputs gives good illustration to
     parallels- contraparallels. Combinations -Z0e and -Ze0 are legal, also
     with -X switch. In Windows version added respective control in menu
     "Obscure Settings".

   * 30. To graphics outputs with -Z -X switches (overview of space
     relatively to local horizon) are added positions of ecliptics (dark
     gray dashed line) and space equator (light gray dashed line).
     Animation of such picture gives good possibility to look to moving of
     planets and important planes in time and hepls to understand problems
     with polar MC and Asc. Here is example of normal chart. In case of
     polar chart is clearly visible, that MC (intersection point of
     ecliptic and south direction) is under local horizon, also Asc
     (intersection point of ecliptic and local horizon) is on west from MC.

   * 31. Fixed my bug with switch -Zd (rising and setting) in polar zone,
     where flipping of MC caused nonexisting hits from planets to MC and
     IC.

   * 32. Fixed bug in calculation of Gauquelin sectors in polar zone. In
     this case some planets can not rise and set during a day. Astrolog
     restricts such planets, but original version don't restores old
     restriction set when returning to standard wheel.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30b1

   * 33. Fixed my own bug, where using SouthNode/Lilith with _b switch
     (don't use ephemeris files) caused in graphics mode error message and
     exit.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30c

   * 34. Missing of control over Proserpina in Windows version caused a lot
     of problems (in Win version). This very serious bug is fixed now.

   * 35. Added two points on the sky - Centre of our Galaxy and Apex of
     Sun. There are different data, better seems data from "Brockhaus ABC
     der Astronimie" (Leipzig 1961):

          Centre of Galaxy: 17h 40' , -29 deg
          Apex of Sun: 18h 04' , +30 deg

     Better data of Centrum of Galaxy gives J. Shklowsky (- 17h 42' 30" -29
     deg 02', results of radioastronomy). Of cource, all theses dara are
     corrected to epoch 1900, used by Astrolog.

   * 36. In text mode added support of 8-bit characters in any place (name,
     place, custom interpretation etc.). In graphics mode Astrolog uses his
     own fonts, and needs additional work to create at least codepage 850
     support.

   * 37. Added new interpretation way, where interpretation is read from
     text files, prepared by user. There are three areas:

        o planets and aspects, where are described meanings of planets in
          signs and houses and their aspects.
        o houses, where are described meanings of positions of house cusps,
          planets in houses etc.
        o meanings of stars (if these are unrestricted).

     NOTE, that interpretation is read from additional text files, which
     must be filled by user. Here you can see full description of this
     feature.

     This interpretation is controlled by switches:

          -Ia - only regrouped info, without interpretation
          -Ib - full interpretation
          -Ip - interpretation of planets
          -Ih - interpretation of houses

     All these switches works also without interpretation files.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30c1

   * 38. Added 8-bit text support also to graphics mode. Because of
     structure of original Astrolog (uses his own font) here is compiled in
     support of codepage 850 (international latin). As I wrote earlyer
     (look above), in text mode actual codepage is supported.

   * 39. Fixed my bug, where some 8-bit characters in first place of name
     or postion caused damage of text chart header.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30c2

   * 40. Fixed bug in my addition to influence (switch -j0) printout. Total
     aspectation of planets was wrong - was added influence of conjunction
     of planet with himself.

   * 41. Aspectation output (switch -j0) is changed. Now are six columns:
     Name of planet, sum of harmonical aspects (trines and sextiles), sum
     of tension aspects (squares and oppositions), sum of harmonical and
     tension aspects, where tension aspects are negative, sum of
     conjuncions, total aspectation of planet.

   * 42. In "flower" graphics output is removed simultaneous influence of
     opposite house cusps - included are conjunctions and trines to
     unrestricted cusps, but removed oppositions and sextiles to allowed
     opposite cusps. That's similar to "smart cusps" option of original
     Astrolog.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30d

   * 43. Added alternative interpretation of positions of dispositors in
     signs and houses. Switches -Ib, -Ip, -Ih are same, than in previous
     versions. Changes and additions:

     -Ia - added info about positions of situative and natural dispositors
     in signs and houses
     -Id - like -Ih, but added interpretations of positions of dispositors
     in signs and houses
     -Io - All possible interpretations. Like -Ib, but added
     interpretations of dispositors in signs and houses.

     Interpretations of positions of dispositors in houses and signs you
     can find in book "The Astrological Tarot" by Georges Mushery,
     published in 1994 by Senate, an imprint of Studio Editions Ltd,
     London.

     NOTE, that interpretation is read from additional text files, which
     must be filled by user. Here you can see full description of this
     feature.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30e

   * 44. Last changes in "alternative interpretation" wasn't reflected in
     Windows version's menus. This omission is fixed.

   * 45. Original Astrolog 5.30 sources (and also older changed versions)
     can't be compiled in text mode without corrections in sources. In
     version 5.30e it's fixed.

   * 46. Changed graphich output "Local Horizon" (switches -X -Z). On
     ecliptics curve (added in version 5.30b) are marked beginnig points of
     zodiacal signs. So finally there are local horizon (horizontal
     stright), space equator (light gray dashed line) and ecliptics (dark
     gray dashed line). Point 0Ari is marked as red, 0Lib as green and all
     other beginning points of zodiacal sings as white points on ecliptics
     curve.
     Animation of this graphics chart is good illustration to problems with
     Houses in polar zone.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30f

   * 47. To graphics wheel and biwheel charts added new feature. Original
     Astrolog (and all previous changed versions) shows all exact (or
     nearly exact) aspects as solid lines, undependently of real power of
     aspect. That means, exact aspect between two very weak planet is
     solid, and not exact (but much more powerful) aspect between two
     important planet is dashed.

     Astrolog 5.30f allows to change dashennes of aspect lines relatively
     to calculated power, not exactness. That means, solid are all aspects
     with power more than 8.0 (default setting), and weak aspects are
     dached even they are exact. New feature is realized in "bonus mode"
     (-Xi switch or pressing the i key in a window). That allows change
     between "aspects by exactness" and "aspects by power" by the fly. In
     some cases changes in chart are great, in some cases small. To be
     sure, which mode is in using, to info border just below "Astrolog
     5.30f" in bonus mode are now words "Bonus mode". Originally in bonus
     mode are shown only planets without aspects.

     One can change minimal aspect power to be solid by new switch -YPp.

          -YPp <value>

     Default value is 8.0. In Windows version value can be changed in menu
     "Obscure settings".

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30g

   * 48. To info-border of graphics wheel charts (single and comparison) is
     added some info of aspects in (or between) chart(s). There are
     outputs:

          Harm = sum of harmonical aspects (trines and sextiles),
          Tens = sum of tension aspects (squares and oppositions),
          Summ = sum of harmonical and tension aspects, where tension
          aspects are negative,
          Conj = sum of conjuncions,
          Total = total aspectation of planet.

     This option is controlled by new switch -XI. If Astrolog is already
     running graphichs wheel chart, this option can be toggled on/off by
     pressing "I".

     In case of single chart that's just same info, whish is printed out in
     last line in -j0 switch text output. In case of comparison charts
     there are summarized aspects between two charts.

   * in aspectation calculations with -j0 switch. There was always used orb
     addition, so all numbers was greater (until 7-8%).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.30g1

   * 50. Fixed my bug, caused by changes in two previous versions. In case
     of graphichs composite chart graphichs wheel was correct, but planets
     positions in infoborder was wrong: there was postitions from first
     chart, not from composite chart. This bug is fixed now.

   * 51. Position of Centre of Galaxy is corrected. Seems, that I made
     there unnecessary transformation of epoch, which caused difference
     about 1 degree. New position for now (26Sag08) matches better with
     other sources than old one (25Sag22).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.31g

Alois Treindl modified Astrolog 5.30 and named new version 5.31. It
contains the new Swiss Ephemeris instead of the older Placalc ephemeris.
The responsibility for this modification is with Alois Treindl. Original
Astrolog 5.31 with all related files is available at
ftp://www.astro.com/pub/astrolog/

Instead of older Placalc ephemeris new ones are used: sepl_xx.se1 for
planets, seas_xx.se1 for astreoids and semo_xx.se1 for Moon. Every set of
files covers 600 years. Windows version has builtin planetary and Moon
ephemeris, which uses another algorithm and covers 3000 BC - 3000 AD.
Though, external ephemeris are more precise and quick. Pkziped set of
ephemeris files sweph_18.zip contains files for 1800 AD - 2400 AD.

   * 52. Just same modification is made with Astrolog 5.30g1, new version
     name is 5.31g. This version hasn't any additional modifications from
     my side.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.41a

Astrolog 5.40 and then 5.41 with Swiss Ephemeris was released.

   * 53. Here I moved all my previous changes from Astrolog 5.31g to new
     original version 5.41. Because Swiss Ephemeris are more precise and
     quick than older Placalc ephemeris, I moved to 5.41 and don't will
     change versions with Placalc anymore. So Astrolog 5.40a doesn't exist.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.41B

   * 54. Added alternative interpretation of TRANSIT-NATAL comparison
     charts, analogious to earlyer alternative interpretation of natal
     charts. For details see file interalt.txt. Sample interpretation files
     with descriptions are in file interalt.zip.

   * 55. Added three new switches (YSa, YSj, YSs) for use in astrolog.dat
     file, which allows to change some default settings:

          =YSa - sets aspects in listings by default as
          applying-separating.
          =YSj - influence text chart shows by default also house's
          influence.
          =YSs - aspect listing shows by default also aspect summary.

   * 56. To most text outputs added headers, where are described type of
     chart, in case of comparison charts also data of both charts. In case
     of multiply charts header is printed only once.

   * 57. To Aspects Configurations list added also "Kite" (described for
     example in lesson about aspects by L. M. C. McPherson.

   * 58. Fixed original Astrolog bug, appeared between versions 5.30 and
     5.40 - positions of planets and Houses in Gauquelin graphics chart
     infoborder was wrong.

   * 59. To Windows version "Help" menu added new item - Open World Atlas,
     which opens WEB browser and connects to infoserver
     http://www.astro.ch/atlas/. (I use it often to find coordinates and
     timezones of different towns). URL is placed into file watlas.url,
     added to package.

   * 60. Fixed original Astrolog omission - Windows version "Help" menu
     looks for necessary files only in local directory. Now these files are
     searched through all directories, connected with astrolog (see
     helpfile for details of setting of environment variables) with
     searching order:

        o 1) Local directory
        o 2) Environment directories, set in autoexec.bat, one of them
          version specific (names of directories as examples, names of
          environment variables must be strict and in upper-case:
             + a) set ASTR5.41B=C:\aaaaa\541
             + b) set ASTROLOG=d:\abbbb
             + c) set ASTR=H:\miscfile
        o 3) Default directory, compiled in: C:\ASTROLOG

     If Astrolog doesn't find file, it doesn't attempt to start wordpad or
     WEB browser but prints only warning, that it can't find file.

   * 61. Improved configuration file astrolog.dat, saved by Windows version
     - all switches of changed versions are in separate section:

          ; SWITCHES, NOT SUPPORTED BY ORIGINAL ASTROLOG

     That simplifies use of the same astrolog.dat file for both changed and
     original versions - for original version simply comment out all
     switches, described in this section.

   * 62. Fixed bug in stars restriction window, appeared in 5.41a (star
     Sheat was always shown as unrestricted).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Astrolog 5.41C

All changes in last version are connected with fixed stars. Main change -
also fixed stars are now calculated by Swiss Ephemeris routines.

   * 63. Stars calculations moved to Swiss Ephemeris, which improved
     precision of calculations. Additional file fixstars.ast is necessary.
     That's specially modified file fixstars.cat from SWEPH, which contains
     data of about 800 fixed stars (actually fixstars.ast is last version
     of fixstars.cat, where data of stars, used by Astrolog, are copied to
     first 74 lines). There are traditional name of star (like Aldebaran),
     canonical name (like alTau), ephemeris and magnitude. Without this
     file all stars calculations are made as in previous versions.

   * 64. If fixstars.ast file is used, name and maginitude from file
     overwrites these internal data of Astrolog and are printed out in
     listings etc. In some printouts are used also canonical names of
     stars.

   * 65. Stars are searched by line (star) number in fixstars.ast file, so
     copying of lines in astrolog.ast to first 74 positions gives
     possibilty to use all stars from this catalogue (in blocks by 74
     stars, allowed by changed Astrolog).

        o Note, that most stars in catalogue hasn't traditional name but
          only canonical name. If you want to use such a stars, I suggest
          to write canonical name also into traditional name field (like
          i'ts made with zeRet in fixstars.ast). In other case you will see
          blank starname(s) in all listings and if such stars are more than
          one, it's difficult to distinguish them (in some printouts they
          can be distinguished by canonical name).

   * 66. Changed stars restrictions menu in Windows version. Internal names
     of stars, used by Astrolog, are overwritten by names from fixstars.ast
     file. Canonical names aren't used there, so if you will use stars with
     blank traditional name filed, it will be blank also in menu.

        o Note, that when Astrolog starts first time with disallowed fixed
          stars, internal stars names are used (because fixstars.ast file
          isn't used in this case). If you use modified fixstars.ast file,
          you have to cast once any chart with all fixed stars
          unrestricted. Then all stars names will be overwritten and with
          next charts you can see there new names from fixstars.ast and use
          them for restriction.

        o In case of alternative stars restriciton you don't need stars
          restriction menu, stars are restricted and unrestricted
          automagically. But after first chart with fixed stars there will
          be names from fixstars.ast.

   * 67. Changed some text outputs:

        o In chart listing object name field is increased to 10 characters,
          (important for stars!), for stars added canonical names instead
          of blank field for velocity.

        o In Local Horizon and Prime Vertical text charts added recpective
          line to header, object names increased to 7 characters.

   * 68. Stars colours can be customized. New switches:

          -YUb1 <value> for stars with magnitude below 1.0
          -YUb2 <value> for stars with magnitude between 1.0 and 2.0
          -YUb3 <value> for stars with magnitude over 2.0

          Colors: ( <value> )

          0 - black, 1 - maroon, 2 - dk. green, 3 - orange, 4 - dk. blue, 5
          - purple, 6 - dk. cyan, 7 - lt. gray, 8 - dk. gray, 9 - red, 10 -
          green, 11 - yellow, 12 - blue, 13 - magenta, 14 - cyan, 15 -
          white.

     "Save settings" in Windows version saves also these stars colours
     settings.

   * 69. To Windows version "Help" menu added new item - Open Fixed Stars,
     which opens WEB browser and connects to infoserver
     http://www.winshop.com.au/annew/. URL is placed into file stars.url,
     added to package.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Astrolog 5.41D

   * 70. Fixed bug in Windows and Unix/Linux versions 5.41C, where use of
     alternative interpretation files causes crach of program.

   * 71. Calculations of Uranianas are also moved from Matrix routines to
     Swiss Ephemeris. No need in additional ephemeris files, these
     ephemeris are in standard SWEPH package. Note, that Proserpina was
     added earlyer by myself and is calculated as previously by Matrix
     routines. So Proserpina is moved to last place and is now Uranian #9
     (not #8 as earlyer).

   * 72. Improved fixed stars ephemeris file fixstars.ast:
        o In previous file all omegas and omicrons had same canonical name
          - om. Now all omegas are clearly ome, all omicrons omi. That
          caused small changes in printout formats where canonical names of
          fixed stars are used.
        o Stars are reordered by constellations, which helps seek of
          necessary stars.
        o Added names to lot of stars.
        o Added some stars, used in astrology, but not listed earlyer. Now
          file contains data of over 1000 fixed stars.

   * 73. Added stars ordering by Prime Vertical. In Windows version it can
     be choosen in Chart settings, in command line versions is added new
     switch -Up.

   * 74. Added new graphics output - local horizon chart in Prime Vertical
     coordinates. In original Astrolog -Z0 switch has different meanings in
     text and graphics modes. In text mode it gets output with prime
     vertical coordinates, in graphics mode it's local horizon output (same
     with -Z), but with other point of view, named in Windows version
     "Horizon Chart Displays With Polar Center" (choose it in "Chart" ->
     "Chart Settings", then "Local Horizon" chart and then Graphics).

        o Original Astrolog output. You lie faced to zehith, head to Nord.
          Zenith is just in centre of screen, upper half is nordic
          hemisphere, internal circle represents local horizon, external
          dashed circle represents "stretched" opposite point Nadir.
          Planets, which are under horizon, are outside internal circle.
          Original Astrolog covered sky up to -90 deg in corners of picture
          and up tp -37 deg latitude in N, E, S and W directions (so area
          inside 53 deg to nadir in these directions is invisible). I
          rescaled picture, so now in these directions is invisible only
          area inside 9 degree from Nadir (visible is part between +90 and
          -81 degree latitude), and in corners is visible "stretched"
          Nadir.

        o To switch to added Prime Vertical mode, hit i (bonus mode). This
          system is exactly perpendicular to previous. You are faced to
          South - horizontal line in centre of screen is local horizon,
          just in centre of screen is southern point of horizon. Part
          inside of internal cicrcle is just in front of you, outside of
          cicrcle behind you. So Zenith is just upper crossing point of
          vertical line and circle, nadir lower one. This picture is scaled
          just as previous one, dached outern circle is "stretched" northen
          point on local horizon.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Astrolog 5.41E

   * 75. Added restriction set for progressed charts (for natal-progressed
     comparison charts only!). To set restrictions for progressed charts a
     new switch -YRP is used in the same way as restrictions and transit
     restricitons are set by -YR and -YRT switches (see helpfile and
     astrolog.dat).

   * 76. Modified power calculations. There are significant changes:

        o 1) Positional power calculations revised and cleaned. This caused
          changes in some settings in the astrolog.dat file (see
          power.txt). Initial powers are revised. Of course, one can play
          with these values to find his own preferred power levels.
        o 2) User can set powers of parallels relative to conjunctions (new
          switch -YOP <value>, default 0.25). In earlier versions this
          default value was fixed.
        o 3) In all planet power calculations only unrestricted aspects are
          used (earlier versions used in some outputs just the 5 main
          aspects).

   * 77. Small changes in headers for comparison text charts - for synastry
     and dual charts the name from the second chart is added.

   * 78. All older versions of Astrolog showed parallel/contraparallel
     aspects as separating. To find out whether a parallel/contraparallel
     is applying, it's necessary to know speeds in latitude but Astrolog
     did not use them, and could not calculate these aspects at all.

     Fortunately the Swiss Ephemeris calculates speeds in latitude, so in
     version 5.41E real appplying/separating parallel/contraparallel
     aspects are calculated. Note that it's necessary to use the Swiss
     Ephemeris to calculate them. With _b switch (don't use ephemeris
     files) Matrix routines are used and speeds in latitude aren't
     calculated, and these aspects won't be calculated in that case - as in
     original version, aspects are then always shown as separating.

   * 79. Fixed a bug in the Windows version, where restrictions of Alnilam
     and Elnath were garbled. Restriction of Alnilam caused the restriction
     of Elnath and vice-versa.

   * 80. Fixed a bug in the Windows version, where it wasn't possible to
     use the "Null" house system.

   * 81. Aspects between fixed stars are removed from all outputs.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last version Astrolog 5.41F

   * 82. Fixed original astrolog bug. POF (in main objects) was wrong in
     case of equatorial coordinates (but in arabic parts list it was
     correct).

   * 83. Colors of all main objects can be changed from default. New switch
     added:

          -Yq <object> <color>

          Just by standard Astrolog rules there are object and color
          numbers or names (see helpfile.540), so all examples below will
          give you blue Mars :)

               -Yq 5 12
               -Yq 5 blue
               -Yq mars 12
               -Yq mars blue

   * 84. Alternative stars restriction works now also with parallels. So if
     (with active "alternative restriction") you switch to parallels (View
     -> Parallel Aspects), unrestricted will be stars which parallels some
     object (if you increase apect numbers for alternative restriction,
     there will be unrestricted stars with contraparallels too).

   * 85. To switch to parallels in command line (DOS or Unix) version (in
     Win version it's simple), there is new switch -YSP. It's useful also
     in some other cases (like in combination with -d switch to see
     parallel-contraparallel events during day/month etc).

   * 86. Added automagic restriction of stars also by prime vertical. There
     are new switches:

          -YUP <value>

          where value:
               0 - switch this off
               1 - unrestricted are stars, which conjuncts some object
               (except cusps, POF etc).
               2 - unrestricted are stars with PV = 0, 45, 90, etc degrees
               3 - unrestricted are both above

          -YUO1 <orb1>
          -YUO2 <orb2>

          These switches are obvious, they sets orbs for automagic
          restrictions above (for YUP 1 and YUP 2 respectively), default
          orbs are 1.166666667 deg (1deg10').
          When you use -YUP <value>, don't worry about switching on/off
          "alternative stars restriction", it will be automatically back to
          previous value when you get -YUP 0.
          I dindn't add anyhing to Windows version menus, all can be
          comfortably done by macros like
          {M0 1 "_v -Z0 -U -Up -YUP 1"}
          DOS version supports all new switches above.

   * 87. Added alternative date format for some outputs (like events search
     with -d switch), where abbreviature of month is printed instead of
     number of month (i.e. "12 Jan 2000" instead of original "12- 1-2000").
     That can be switched by new switch -Yn. Default setting is Astrolog's
     original one (numeric month), =Yn switches to abbreviatures.

   * 88. Names and abbreviatures of aspects can be customized. New
     switches:

          -An <n> <name>
          -AA <n> <abbreviature>

          There n is number of aspect, name and abbreviature are new name
          and abbreviature for this aspect. Best way to use is put them to
          astrolog.dat file.

          NB! <abbreviature> MUST be three characters. Astrolog doesn't
          check lenght of new abbreviature, and in other case most outputs
          where aspect abbreviatures are used, will be distorted.

   * 89. Astrolog computes position of Lilith (Dark Moon) using external
     ephemeris. When -b setting is off, Astrolog will display the position
     of the South Node instead (see helpfile.540, description of -HO
     switch). Position of Lilith is calculated by Swiss Ephemeris only if
     central planet is Earth, and in version 5.41F if central planet isn't
     Earth, Lilit is analogiously replaced by South Node even if -b switch
     is on.

   * 90. Original Astrolog doesn't replace central object in comparison
     grid charts. In version 5.41F changes of central planet are reflected
     also there.

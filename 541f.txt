Changes in last version Astrolog 5.41F

   * Fixed original astrolog bug. POF (in main objects) was wrong in
     case of equatorial coordinates (but in arabic parts list it was
     correct).

   * Colors of all main objects can be changed from default. New switch
     added:

          -Yq <object> <color>

          Just by standard Astrolog rules there are object and color
          numbers or names (see helpfile.540), so all examples below will
          give you blue Mars :)

               -Yq 5 12
               -Yq 5 blue
               -Yq mars 12
               -Yq mars blue

   * Alternative stars restriction works now also with parallels. So if
     (with active "alternative restriction") you switch to parallels (View
     -> Parallel Aspects), unrestricted will be stars which parallels some
     object (if you increase apect numbers for alternative restriction,
     there will be unrestricted stars with contraparallels too).

   * To switch to parallels in command line (DOS or Unix) version (in
     Win version it's simple), there is new switch -YSP. It's useful also
     in some other cases (like in combination with -d switch to see
     parallel-contraparallel events during day/month etc).

   * Added automagic restriction of stars also by prime vertical. There
     are new switches:

          -YUP <value>

          where value:
               0 - switch this off
               1 - unrestricted are stars, which conjuncts some object
               (except cusps, POF etc).
               2 - unrestricted are stars with PV = 0, 45, 90, etc degrees
               3 - unrestricted are both above

          -YUO1 <orb1>
          -YUO2 <orb2>

          These switches are obvious, they sets orbs for automagic
          restrictions above (for YUP 1 and YUP 2 respectively), default
          orbs are 1.166666667 deg (1deg10').
          When you use -YUP <value>, don't worry about switching on/off
          "alternative stars restriction", it will be automatically back to
          previous value when you get -YUP 0.
          I dindn't add anyhing to Windows version menus, all can be
          comfortably done by macros like
          {M0 1 "_v -Z0 -U -Up -YUP 1"}
          DOS version supports all new switches above.

   * Added alternative date format for some outputs (like events search
     with -d switch), where abbreviature of month is printed instead of
     number of month (i.e. "12 Jan 2000" instead of original "12- 1-2000").
     That can be switched by new switch -Yn. Default setting is Astrolog's
     original one (numeric month), =Yn switches to abbreviatures.

   * Names and abbreviatures of aspects can be customized. New
     switches:

          -An <n> <name>
          -AA <n> <abbreviature>

          There n is number of aspect, name and abbreviature are new name
          and abbreviature for this aspect. Best way to use is put them to
          astrolog.dat file.

          NB! <abbreviature> MUST be three characters. Astrolog doesn't
          check lenght of new abbreviature, and in other case most outputs
          where aspect abbreviatures are used, will be distorted.

   * Astrolog computes position of Lilith (Dark Moon) using external
     ephemeris. When -b setting is off, Astrolog will display the position
     of the South Node instead (see helpfile.540, description of -HO
     switch). Position of Lilith is calculated by Swiss Ephemeris only if
     central planet is Earth, and in version 5.41F if central planet isn't
     Earth, Lilit is analogiously replaced by South Node even if -b switch
     is on.

   * Original Astrolog doesn't replace central object in comparison
     grid charts. In version 5.41F changes of central planet are reflected
     also there.

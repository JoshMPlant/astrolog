- Added processing of GTOPO30 data.
  -ZC drawmap.pgm gtopo (currently assumed to contain 30-70N,10W-20E)
  converts drawmap.pgm to internal format file gtopo.
  
  The .pgm can be created from GTOPO30 DEM files using
  the application drawmap(-2.5) by Fred M. Erickson
  fme@ttc-cmc.net using command

  drawmap -t -x3600 -y4800 -w -l30,20,70,-10 -d W020N90.HDR
               -d W020N40.HDR -h

  The GTOPO30 Data are available at
  searchword GTOPO30 google

- Switch -YTN sets altitude from longitude,latitude using gtopo file.

- There was a problem with timezones in -rm combin charts.

- Switch -YTD for 3dimensional aspect angles (instead of
  ecliptic ). For now with -a -Tn -D but not -t -d etc..
  Ecliptic latitude of observer is neglected.

- Cleanup with DEFAULT values initialization for location/timezone.

- Added linear approximation between GTOPO30 data points.

- Added configureable DEFAULT values for GTOPO30 data range (default Western Europe 30-70n 10w-20e)

- -RS restriction are observed with -d and relationship -a

- Fixed bug that sometimes left out strongest aspect with -a

- Fixed bug with -L and -YTH combined

- Sidereal positions are calculated using Swiss ephemeris instead of rSid.
  Added switch -st for using ecliptic of (first used) date
  -ss for using solar system plane
  -sm for selecting numerical predefined sidereal mode (see swisseph documentation)
  Try -s -sm 255 for precession-neglected transits.

- Added suffix 0 for -R switch to restrict (instead of switch) group.
  for example -Rc0 restricts centaurs (-Rc would switch restrictions of centaurs)

- Fixed bug with -o option in SzLocationAlt

- Fixed sidereal position for riyal objects (less precise).

- Fixed bug with fixed stars stringhandling for builds on Windows 2000 without WIN and GRAPH

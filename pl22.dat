They don't waste any time on reflection. They follow their impulses immediately. They are competitive and constantly want to prove themselves by action. They want to be first, which they regard as also being best. Their presentation of themselves is direct.
&01 02
Their movements are a bit slow and they often have a quite sluggish radiation. They are physically strong and persevering. Stubborn and a bit obstinate they can still carry out the undertakings that they have started - or have been instructed to perform. They are often physically attractive and beautiful. A bit phlegmatic, they have trouble getting started. But if they are provoked or rushed, a furious energy and aggressiveness may emerge. They can be selfish, lazy and don't forgive things easily. They have to do things their own way. A tendency towards corpulence due to a weakness for the good things in life and a constant munching.  Indolence.
&01 03
They are of a communicative and verbal disposition. Quick to draw conclusions and easily express themselves. Many interests. One recognizes them mainly by their movable expression and ardent gesticulating. Humor. They easily identify themselves with ideas and conceptions and therefore they often appear intellectual. They easily imitate and render others ideas.
&01 04
Gives a very emotional and sensitive personality. They are extremely vulnerable and have trouble expressing their feelings unless they receive encouragement. Their feelings are romantic and dramatic and surface as soon as they feel accepted and well liked. Since they have a strong will and a desire to receive acknowledgement, they often take initiatives that lead to some public engagement. That they later wish they would have refrained from.
&01 05
Gives an impressive and strong-willed personality. They are usually exceptionally popular. But there is a risk that they may become too demanding due to their need to dominate others. They are typical "winners." They are proud and independent and have a great need to take the right position in a company. Dramatic talent.
&01 06
The Ascendant in this sign gives a cautiously and critically disposed personality. Their mental sharpness manifests in and through the practical affairs of life. They are systematic and possess good organizing ability. Their excellent discernment can turn them into real nitpickers. They are perfectionists and do best under the leadership of others. But most often they don't have enough self-criticism to realize that they should adapt themselves and submit to others. They have a very dexterous way of handling most things and it is from this talent that the Virgo draws his pride. He knows that he IS better and more exact than others. Unfortunately, however, he lacks the quality that makes a true leader figure - charisma!
&01 07
They need and seek social confirmation of their experiences. Therefore they work splendidly in co-operation with others. They try to obtain harmony and beauty in every respect. They have a strong sense of justice and want to balance all extreme manifestations in social life. They are splendid mediators. They have a great aptitude for organizing parties and entertainment. They have a large need for company and relations. They are also artistically inclined and creative by nature, but they need the support and encouragement of others in order to gain success.
&01 08
They have strong and deeply rooted motivating instincts which give them a perseverance and will-power that isn't found in very many.
& They are of a contending and power-seeking nature who don't know of any limitations. They have intense feelings which seldomly come to the surface, which causes them often to be regarded as ruthless and cold.
& Scorpio can like none other make use of different resources which others don't know how to utilize.
&01 09
Sagittarius Ascendant gives enthusiastic and optimistic personalities. Their ambitions are always about great and fantastic projects, often located in foreign countries or somehow far-away from everyday life. They have the ability to inspire other people into seeing the different positive sides of life. At the same time they are philosophically inclined, which sometimes can give them a prophetic-charismatic streak of an unusual kind.
&01 10
They have a serious, reserved and a quite cold personality. As children they are precocious.  They have great self-control and often appear a bit melancholy. They are waiting for the right opportunity to show their abilities. They are ambitious.
&01 11
It gives an original or at least unusual appearance. They often look strange and one may wonder if they aren't making a conscious effort just to seem deviant. They are extremely alert and inventive. They easily become involved in different group and club activities. Avant-garde.
&01 12
It gives sympathetic, impressionable and sensitive personalities. They are artistic and musical.  A far too strong fantasy and sensibility may turn them away from concrete reality and that may result in them either creating a fantasy world of their own or escaping with the help of artificial means.

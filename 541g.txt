Changes in last version Astrolog 5.41G


* Fixed original Astrolog bug, where Local Horizon data (and also
Prime Vertical) were off by up to several arc-minutes.


* Fixed original Astrolog bug (Windows version), where "Time / Space 
Midpoint" chart is correct, but it was not possible to return back to
"No relationship chart" - there was still previous "midpoint" chart.


* In "Rising and Setting" chart fixed bug, where "Print Nearest Second"
worked unproperly - seconds weren't shown for risings and settings.

In this context more correct termin instead "zenith" and "nadir" is
astronomical termin "culmination" which means transit over meridian.
There are two culminations: "upper culmination" when planet has
highest position and "lower culmination" when planet has lowest
position. So in the chart termins "zeniths" and "nadirs" are replaced
by "culm.(up)" and "culm.(lo)" respectively.  V.A.


* Uncorrect object name "Nadir" has been replaced by corret "IC". Nadir 
has different meaning than IC, Nadir is point on the sky, opposite to
Zenith. 


* Slightly improved Windows version behaviour in case of progressed and 
relationship charts. Earlyer versions allowed to do progression and 
then do some relationship chart like Natal-Progressed. Or vice versa, 
when looking say Natal-Progressed chart switch also Progression "on". 
That all confused Astrolog and results were often unpredictable.

Now any use of relationship charts (in menu "Info") switches off "Do
Progression" (in "Chart" -> "Progressions"). And vice versa, switching
progression on (in "Chart" -> "Progression") switches off any comparison.
As result Astrolog is displaying just what it has to dasplay, no 
confusion.


* Fixed orignal astrolog bug (appeared only in Windows version). 
When natal chart was opened from file with saved planets position
(not birth data), there only first output was correct, all next 
charts (as aspect list, transit searches, all comparison charts etc)
had wrong planets positions. 

NB! Use such input files carefully! They are treated by astrolog as 
files "with no time and space", so a lot of chart types can't be used 
with them. An examples are all progression chartt, because they needs
birth-chart time to calculate progressions. 


* Fixed bug of changed versions, where in case of use of data with saved
planet positions (just as above), data-border of graphics charts 
dilsplayed info "no time or space" twice.


* Time and location have new format - with seconds, both for input and
output. Only outputs with old data format are events searching outputs,
because they anyway can be off by a few minutes, so seconds are 
unnecessary there.

All files with old time/location format can be used, but all outputs 
are saved only in new time/location format. 


* Calculation precision improved - time-dependent obliquity of ecliptic
is used instead of fixed value.


* Added new switsh to change local horizon text output from default ENWS
to NESW. Just add line

=YZ

to astrolog.dat file and it will be deafult setting.


* Slightly changed Prime Vertical text chart output: Altitude and 
Azimuth in header have been replaced by Amplitude and Prm-Vrt. You 
can see this chart, if you choose "Local Horizon" and set "Horison 
Chart with Polar Center / Prime Vert. (text)" in "Chart settings". 
Note, that this switch has different meanings for text and graphics 
charts: in text mode it switches between Local Horizon <-> Prime 
Vertical outputs, in graphics it switches between "normal wiew" and 
"view vith Polar Center". However, one can switch also between Polar
Center and Pime Vert. also in graphics by hitting 'i' on the keyboard
(switch to bonus mode). 


* Changed calculations of Solar Arc progressions. Astrolog calculates
there actually Solar Arc directions, where all planets and house cusps 
positions are moved forward to an amount equal in degrees to the number 
of years that have passed between the specified date and the chart 
in question. Because real (even mean or average) motion of Sun isn't 
1 degree per day, resulting Solar Arc Sun position doesn't match with 
secondary progressed Sun position (but they must match).

To correct this situation, there has been added another calculation of 
Solar Arc - first secondary progressed Sun's position is determined and 
then all chart components are moved accordlingly.

To avoid misunderstanding, existing Solar Acr calculations remains, but 
have now corrected name "Degree Per Day/Month", as earlyer one can change 
amount of degrees per year (more strictly, amount of days for 1 degree 
direction. See description of -p0 and -pd switches in helpfile.540).
Added calculation is named "Solar Arc Directions" and there Sun's position
follows secondary progressed Sun positions, all other point in chart are
moved accordlingly.

Existing switches -p0, -p0n remain as previously. For new correct "Solar Arc 
Directions" calculations new switches -p1 and -p1n are used. In Windows 
version all can be done through menus: "Chart" -> "Progressions..." 


* Slightly changed chraphics charts' infoborder and text charts' headers
- secondary progressed charts are still named as "progressed", Solar Arc
and "Degree per Year/Mont" are marked as "directed" with name of direction.


* Graphics chart's infoborder has additional information: Obliquity of 
ecliptic, Sidereal time, Delta T (in seconds) and in case of sidereal chart
Ayanamsha (sidereal offest). 

Note, that Ayanamsha has negative value and dafaults to Fagan Bradley. 
Ayanamsha control in "Calculation Settings"has a dropdown to allow quick 
selection of some common systems of sidereal astrology. The values are 
additions to default value and they are 0.0 for Fagan Bradley, 0.883333 
(or 0 degrees 53') for N.C. Lahiri, 0.983333 (or 0 degrees 59') for 
Krishnamurti, and 2.333333 (or 2 degrees 20') for B.V. Raman. On the screen
has shown resulting value.


* Date/time and Julian Day in the graphics charts' infoboredr has been colored:

  1. First (or single) data/time is always bright white.

  2. Second date/time is always yellow.

  3. JD (which is actually also time/date) has color of corresponding 
  date/time above (as yellow in case of transit comparison or direction
  charts). If JD doesn't correspond to neither date/time above (as in case
  of progressions where JD corresponds to date/time of planets' positions on
  the screen), color is green. Note, that in case of Synastry and Comparison
  charts JD will be yellow, becsuse it corresponds to second date/time above
  (data of second chart).


* Windows version controls of progressed charts have been polished. They looks 
more clear now. As default 365.2422 (tropical) year has used.

In "Degree per Days" dropdown are also available:
365.25636 (sidereal year)
27.321582 (tropical month)
27.321661 (sidereal month)
29.530588 (synodic month)

Other more exotic (like Draconic) years/months aren't included.


* Astrolog computes position of Lilith (Dark Moon) using external
ephemeris. When -b setting is off, Astrolog will display the position
of the South Node instead (see helpfile.540, description of -HO
switch). For users, who wants to use South Node always, there has been 
added new switch =YN which forces Astrolog to do it. This switch can be
entered through "Edit" -> "Enter Command Line" (Windows version) or 
simply added to astrolog.dat file to make this behaviour default.


* By default Astrolog calculates mean Lilith. For users who wants to use
osculting position of Lilith, new switch -YL has been added. As above,
this switch can be added to astrolog.dat file, which makes such behaviour
default.

- fix omissions in data2.c (interpretations unnumbered objects)

- Fix bug with parallel transit restrictions (-t -YSp -RT0 object which is restricted in natal)

- With -d -YSp, parallels and contraparallels may be restriced (-A 0/1) to leave only declination events

- With -t -YSp, contraparallels can be restricted with -A 1

- Do not try to progress chart with -t -YSp -pt for now

- Observe -YTC,-YTR,-YTA mostly with unnumbered objects

- display of Out of Bounds events with -d -YSp, restrictions with 3rd argument to -YR0 

- display of Out of Bounds in -sr listing 

- add -yp1,-yp2,-rp1,-rp2 switches

- correction for compiling PC&X11

- merged in KDE code (modified from kastrolog by C.Gros)
  This needs Qt,KDE etc....
  This needs the Truetype Fontserver setup on linux
  and some fonts installed. This is only initial so far
  as the menus are not quite up to date but some extensions are done.

- fix line lost since 5.42H for ayanamsa display 

- fix for unnumbered topocentric together with non-geocentric (topocentric is ignored)

- Changes from Swiss Ephemeris v1.64.00

- Use swe_get_ayanamsa_name with -b1 switch

July 2002

- Changes from Swiss Ephemeris v1.64.01

- Updated seasnam.txt file

- Updated deltat forecast 20030101

- Added UR163,CR46 to hardcoded, removed from unnumbered, removed also HX11 and HB12.

- Print Eclipse Zodiac location with -ZEs,-ZEl
  This depends on the location set with -zl,-zL for topocentric moon position / eclipse time

- Added switch -ZEo object for lunar occultations

- Fix some of the omissions Starbright/dist in data2.c

- Added switch -Zc ,-Zcl , -Zco object for chart of next eclipse/occultation

- Added switch -ZEb,Zcb for calculating eclipses/occultations backwards

- Modification default astrolog.dat

- Added switch -yr file object for returns. The switch -ZEb is used for calculating a return backwards
  In X Mode, + and - is used to jump one return back and forth. Both -r1 -r2 can be used
  to show either Return chart alone or together with natal.
  e.g. astrolog -i file Sun shows next solar return chart
  Use sidereal mode 255 for sidereal returns in tropical coordinates, e.g. -s -sm 255 
  Works only in tropical and sidereal coordinates so far.

- Fix bug with degree sign character 128/248

- Fix bug with sidereal mode 255 and ecliptic of date when recasting charts.
  The -st switch is now no longer needed for turning on ecliptic of natal date flag,
  this is turned on automatically in sidereal mode 255.
  Instead it will take as an argument a julian day number if the date of ecliptic 
  should be manually set,otherwise it will be set to the natal date.
  In that case the ecliptic should stay with this date and not pick up the natal date.
  This bug was affecting the jumping of sidereal returns in tropical coordinates with +- key in 
  graphical mode. 

- Fix bug sometimes causing segmentation fault in paranatellontas routine charts3.c (if variable ll>>occurcount)

- In ChartEphemeris()/Switch -E if switch -b1 is activated, more header details are printed

- For chart listing with switch -sr, velocity is also transformed with Swiss Ephemeris activated.

- Draconic Positions need lunar node and solar position for calculation even if Sun/Node restricted

- Add switch -ZEn number for number of eclipses to show with -ZE listing

- Add observation of -RS restrictions with parallels -d -YSp

- Add observation of -G geodetic switch together with Swe Houses -YTH

- Combination -d -YTD now shows list of maximum/minimum angle occuring.
  The accuracy of the resulting angle and reported time depends on the -d division setting.

- Correction MinDistance3D/MinDifference3D :
  Switch between arccos and power series expansion now at 0.05 instead of 0.5 degrees.

- Combination -t -YTD now shows list of maximum/minimum transit angle occuring.
  The accuracy of the resulting angle and reported time depends on the -d division setting,
  and is less than with -d switch.
  To reduce the number of events displayed, you may try turning off topocentric positions
  which have a daily oscillation, use mean node/apogee instead of true node/oscillating apogee
  and ignore objects that are stationary.

- Add switch -rc3 for linear ratio of composite between two charts according to mixing date.
  e.g. astrolog -qd 6 22 2002 -rc3 solarreturn2001 solarreturn2002 mixes the 2 solarreturns as of Jun 22,2002,
  for the cusps is similar to progression of solar return. Mixing Date should be between the two charts,
  and usually earlier chart should be on the left side (chart#1), otherwise is reverse.
  Overwrites chart #3 with mixing date.

- Fix bug from update UR163/CR46 in riyal asteroids, now again correct objects displayed with
  aastrolog -R0y

- Reintroduce 1999 HX11 to hardcoded asteroids (TNO) as newly named Rhadamanthus

- Fix bug that Chaos is not ignored before 1500 with astrolog executable.

- update from latest Riyal, add GO9,AW197,KY14,GB10,GZ32,YK61,KX14

- added Switch -ys file obj1 obj2 for synodic returns, e.g. -ys file Sun Moon shows recurrence
  of natal Sun-Moon angle

- Switch -ZE in combination with -yr and -ys switch shows list of returns (as with lists of eclipses)

- Use long instead of short integers in GridInfo structure to allow for correct calculation of large orbs

- Add -Tp0,-Tp1,-Tp2,-Tp3 switches to show directions info.

- Do not indicate returns in declination with -T -YSp

- update from latest Riyal

- update from Swiss Ephemeris v1.64.02, latest deltat and tidal accelaration, half hour changes for BC charts

- update from Riyal v.0.955 b

- Changes in -ZE output format, colored zodiac location

- Added switch -Zes,-Zeo obj for eclipse details at given location

- Added switch -ZeO,-ZEO to search for lunar occultations with objects according to restrictions locally and globally
  Still buggy,may hang with some objects like Tantalus,Khufu and Damocles.

- Added switch -r file1 file2 -ma shows aspects from file1 to midpoints of file2  

- Replaced hypothetical Isis with Selena (White Moon) 

- Fix bug with app/sep aspects in -Tp0,-Tp1,-Tp3 switch

- Fix bug with omissions -Nrs deg1 deg2 -b0 switch

- Fix bug with unnumbered asteroids not ignored with -b switch

- In chart listing with seconds precision, move one digit from velocity to distance

- Correction in FNode, include object itself

- extended alternate Star Restrictions (switch -YU) also to other objects.
  The objects which are alternately restricted are those ignored with -RS restrictions. 
  Objects where aspects are required for the alternate restriction not to filter are those open with -RS restriction 

- added some more interpretations for unnamed centaurs according to copyrighted file from Philip
  Sedgwick, GALASTRO@aol.com

- update seasnam.txt

- add calculation of Gauqelin sectors using swiss ephemeris routine if -YTH selected.
  Depends on -YTF switch for use of refraction or not.Does not work with unnumbered asteroids.
  In that case , turn off -YTH 

- fix? bug with unnumbered asteroids in sidereal -s. Does not want swi_nutate

- 22May 2003 update from Riyal v1.0, naming of Huya and Pelion


- added switch -NS to ignore gaps in asteroid ephemeris files.

- Extra Asteroids are ignored if not turned on (Flag ExtraAst added)

- added switch -Ns to output sorted by rank in -j influence listing.

- Another cleanup on macro switches PLACALC / ASTEROIDS /GRAPH etc...

- Switch -Ns for sorting output also applies to normal object listing
  Using new switch -ND the degree modulo can be set,also negative. Default is 30 (degree of any sign).
  360 shows ordered in the zodiac,120 degree of any sign by element, 90 by cardinality 
  and so on. If the value is negative,reverse sorting is taking place.

- Added switches -Nr -NR to define the range which should be displayed
  in -Ns sorted chart listing
  -Nr degfrom degto 
  -NR objectname orb
  e.g. -NR Sun 1 shows everything +-1 degree from the sun position
	   -Nr 333 334 shows everything between 3Pis and 4Pis

- Increased Number of extra asteroids

- Fixed several problems with -N switch
  The subswitch for aphelions&perihelions vs nodes is now h instead of a
  The subswitch for aphelions vs. perihelions/asc. vs desc. node is d
  The subswitch for second focal point is f
  The subswitch for mean nodes where defined is m
  The subswitch for barycentric vs.heliocentric nodes/apsides where really returned by swiss ephemeris is b

- In -j0 influence calculation, scale back aspect power somewhat with nr of objects
  (That is introduced because the sum of asteroid influence is somewhat defined too high if
   many asteroids are considered,
   but i prefer to leave influences unchanged/unscaled with changing nr of objects
   considered and scale back the aspect influence then) 
   Also subtract noise (aspect power of least aspected object) from final aspect power
   to have more distinction.

- Subtract noise (power of weakest object) from object power.

- Added switch -NT treshold to ignore objects with power below treshold
  on following computations and output. Default=0
  Changed calculation of influences in several places, -T , -D
  With -NT and -T, the transit configuration is also examined and
  plays a role for total transit influence (otherwise only the
  configured transit influence is considered). This is because
  these have to be evaluated anyway for selecting the asteroids.  
  This switch is so far used in listing (no switch),-T,-D
  Not with -t -d here you should restrict yourself.
  The idea is to find interesting asteroids at a particular date
  from a large selection. After you have found some asteroid you can include
  it but it is too slow for -t etc.. with all asteroids simultaneously. 

- Some optimization, so that if no Extra Asteroids,Hypothetical Uranians
  or Stars are used, the performance will increase,resp. be not much worse
  than version 5.41F. See comments below
 
- The -NA switch now needs 2 instead of 1 arguments.
  First argument is the starting numbered object
  Second argument is how many extra asteroids (following the starting numbered
  object) to load.
  There is an upper limit, in this case a error message will be displayed.  

- New switch -NU nr1 nr2 .. nrx  that loads those asteroids numbers into extra asteroid space
  NU may be used after -NA but will be overwritten if before

- Reduced file searching in sweph.c, the ast files are expected in astxx subdirectories
  under the ephemeris path, and short files are expected.
  Needed to be changed if you have access to long range integration files for other asteroids
  but these are the only ones freely available at www.astro.com for now.
  This improves performance with -NA and -NN

- Introduced use of secondary -RS restrictions in -a -j
  Example : Aspect of anything to the ascendant :  -a -R1 -RS0 Ascendant
  This way with a large number of asteroids, not the whole grid has to be filled
  if you neglect aspects between 2 of those asteroids and concentrate on aspects between 1 of
  these asteroids and one of the major objects

- A major internal rebuild was done in shifting the extra asteroids behind the stars and
  hypothetical Transuranians. Unfortunately this means there are quite a few bugs left.
  Also for this, the makefile was adapted and now 2 executables are built, astrolog
  and aastrolog and only aastrolog contains the extra asteroids.
   
- Some optimization, so that if no Extra Asteroids,Hypothetical Uranians
  or Stars are used, the performance will increase,resp. be not much worse
  than version 5.41F. This collided with the rebuild above and means that currently
  aastrolog would crash in X mode if no extra asteroids are loaded (e.g. this optimization
  is active). Therefore aastrolog now by default loads some extra asteroids so that the
  optimization is turned off. Without extra asteroids you should use the astrolog executable

- Also on windows only the astrolog executable without graphics works as far as i have tried.

- Switch -IS for sabian symbols added 

- Switch -NL for loading a selection of unnumbered Centaurs,SDO,TNO 
  Their positions are taken from ephemeris files used with the Application Riyal
  by J.Revilla http://www.expreso.co.cr/centaurs 
  The accuracy of these positions is lower due to uncertainties in orbital elements and
  due to less extensive ephemeris data (200 day steps). Also Nodes&apsides
  are so far not calculated for these.

  The ephemeris files tnpsdo.fle and centaurs.fle should be installed in EPHE_DIR.
 
  These are available only with #define ASTEROIDS,e.g. aastrolog

  They are turned on/off using switch -Ry etc. and key " on the graphical chart.


- The number of objects in aastrolog is meanwhile so large that also on linux the full grid may practically
  not be allocated. Use -NT xx to reduce number of active objects. I guess it would be necessary to switch
  to a shared memory architecture.

- Added switch -Nt targetdistance (in AU) to emphasize objects at the specified distance

- Stars are now handled in same loop in chart listing, no more separate from other objects
  
- Riyal longrange ephemeris are also used by aastrolog between 602AD and 1500AD for main centaurs/TNO
  without longrange swisseph. There is a slight discontinuity at 1500AD.

- Topocentric/True positions flags are also observed for fixstars
  (switches -YTC -YTR )
  Please note that there may be some astronomical issues with this. 

- Modified sweph.c to return brightness of star in xx[2]. Distance in lightyears in xx[3], uncertainty of
  distance in xx[4]. Some star distances were taken from www.cosmobrain.com,file fixstars.ast is still incomplete.
  Is displayed in chart listing except uncertainty. If Swisseph is turned off (-b), brightness is displayed twice.

- added switch -zL to read longitude/latitude from clear text file atlas.txt to be installed in EPHE_DIR
  2 consecutive spaces mark end of Location (if you want the country included for selection, remove all but one space
  between town and country in atlas.txt). If two words are given they have to be put in quotes:
  e.g. -zL 'New York'. It has to match exactly up to the end of the given string.

- On Sparc chips because of different endian -NL did not work (bogus values displayed).
  added handling of bigendian chips (e.g. sun sparc) 
  depends on #ifdef _BIGENDIAN

- Corrected reintroduced bug with progr.asc.,composite X-display

- Wider output formatting -Z,-j


- Print declination of cusps with -sr

- Add factor dependent on sign degree for influence
  (max at 12, min at 29 and 1 degrees)

- Add factor dependent on proximity to cusp for influence
  (max at cusp, min at 0.6847*house, linear approx)
  Between 0.6847 and 0.966 of house object is counted for both house it is in
  and next one. After 0.966 only for next house.

- Add display of stationary objects and increase 
  influence of stationary objects.
  Does not work without swisseph -b (Distance needed)

- Added macro -M 5 for more ancient rulerships in default astrolog.dat

- Corrected bug if stars considered for -j listing

- Parallels also considered for cusps&stars in -j listing

- Corrections for -Z so that Asc is at 0 altitude without refraction

- Different Labels for Prime Vertical (from 5.41G)

- internal changes seconds processing (similar 5.41G)

- Fix for -p0 arc calculation,using fixed arc per unit of time (similar 5.41G)

- Added -p1 solar arc direction calculation,using solar position of progression (similar 5.41G)

- Added -p2,-tp2,-dp2 progression of progression calculation

- added 3 latest numbered Centaurs/SDO/TNO, added 763 Cupido to hardwired,
  dropped 4 other hardwired asteroids (Daphne,Thetis,Aurelia,Artemis)

- correction for -dp[012]Y switch handling enabled

- added switch -sg for galactic coordinates, Zero Point 0Cap instead of 0Ari
  for more custom signs, but normal if -sh or -sd selected. 
  Needs update of fixstars.ast for galactic reference points.
  Transformation of Speed also added. Uses sweph even with -b, but matrix position and unit distance

- Ignore unknown asteroids without Swiss Ephemeris -b.
  Automatically turn off Swe Houses in that case.

- Cleanup/Fillup Data Tables.

- More info with -X,-w (similar 5.41G)

- Added Switch -Zdp to show kind of paranatellontas from rise/set table.
  -RS restricts which objects are look at to rise/culm up/set/culm lo within conjunction orb together with -R restricted objects,
  -YRZ 0 0 0 0 restricts rise/culm up/set/culm lo
  astrolog -R1 -RS0 Sun -YRZ 0 1 1 1 -YAo 1 1 1 shows what is rising with the sun within 1degree=4minutes (maybe plus orb addidtion).
  Please note that Sun/Moon rise times refer to the border of the disc and not the center, e.g. first and last sunray.

- Bugfix riyal long term object assignment

- Added more verbose display of calculation settings (switch -b1)

- add switch -YZ for NESW azimuth display (like 5.41G ), is also new default instead of ENWS as before.

- changes for reading longterm .sx1 files produced by solex and switch -ZC 
  (Target May 6,2002 MPCORB & 10000 200day steps back to 3473BC.)

  Files needed as of May7,2002

- Fixed bug with object center other than earth/sun (Only part of objects transformed,
  added transformation of distance and velocities , no aberration etc. corrections)

- Improved precision Galactic points in fixstars.ast, yields precise IAU 1958 Galactic coordinate frame.

- Added supergalactic reference points to fixstars.ast and display
  supergalactic coordinates with -ss -sg combination.
  In Zodiac sign display, 0Can is used as zero point for more custom signs
  (similar to 0Cap for galactic coordinates)
  Use -sh or -sd for standard numerical values.

- fix omissions in xdata.c (causing aastrolog -X crash) 

- Replace hardcoded Minerva with 15504 RG33

- Use short swiss ephemeris files for Chariklo/Hylonome

  for parallel aspects

September 2006

- replace SB93/SC94 with Eris and Logos 

- naming Crantor,Echeclus,Amycus (Their Riyal Orbits possibly out of date, it is recommended to use them with swe files,e.g. -NU ,-Na switches  )

- Upgrade to Swiss Ephemeris version 1.71 (from 1.64.02)
  The previous modifications were not taken in again.
  Therefore the star distance and brightness is broken.
  However the old starfile fixstars.ast was taken in as a replacement
  for the original fixstars.cat in swiss ephemeris so that
  especially the galactic coordinates and similar will continue to work.
  The performance with many unspecified asteroids will be somewhat slower due
  to standard swe file search path,especially if there are asteroid gaps.

- Raise maximum asteroid number from 100000 to 150000

- Adaptions because of SWE function swe_get_planet_name

- astrolog.dat contains only planets , dwarf planets and chiron by default

- aastrolog.dat contains most named Centaurs, TNOs , SDO and a few unnamed by default

- Partially outdated Riyal orbits disabled by default in aastrolog.dat

- asteroid names file seasnam.txt updated

November 2006

- Naming of Typhon and Ceto

- Alternate Interpretion files edited for linebreaks

- correct aspect orbs printing in intrpalt.c for transiting aspects (-yt file -Ib switch)

December 2007

- add Borasisi (66652) and Teharonhiawako (88611) in aastrolog.dat

- Upgrade to Swiss Ephemeris version 1.72.00

- Fixes with lunar occultations searches, swe changes, was broken

June 2008

- 5.40 license file recovered

February 2009

- changes for X includes in Makefile and Makefile.cyg
  so it compiles with Windows Vista and current Cygwin

- add switch -YT1 to toggle forced restrictions for chaotic orbists etc.

- Improvements with longrange objects .sx1 files precision

- New .sx1 files created, some with slightly updated orbits

- .sx1 files contain header line with JD startdate, stepsize and scaling

March 2009

- NU switch with negative argument looks for comet file sc00nnn.sx1

- long.fle file rebuilt 

- Earth/Sun restrictions can be handled by the user, program will not
  attempt to choose itself any longer

- riyal.c .sx header accepts stepsize in 0.1/0.2/0.5/1 Julian Years
  to use output from orbit9 / OrbFit4.0
  ( at http://adams.dm.unipi.it )

- header output -b1 changed for sidereal mode, -b1 is somewhat misleading for now

- -st value defaults to J2000

- -YTJ switch added, use JPL DE405/DE406 ephemeris files via swiss eph SEFLG_JPLEPH

- modified -NN,-NA switch , now looking for .sx1 files as well

- modified path for SWE, use SE_EPHE_PATH first and EPHE_DIR from local.h,set JPLEPH path
  Do not use other stuff anymore.

- if 4th letter of (text) shortname of object is numerical digit, continue searching,
  e.g. astrolog -R0 Cha1 finds Chariklo, astrolog -R0 Cha2 finds Chaos
  use -HO switch for checking current object numbers and ordering.

- load larger (1079 entries) fixstars catalogue if -NL not set (with #define ASTEROIDS,e.g.aastrolog) .

- -R switch can ignore or show object groups ,e.g -Rc1 shows hardcoded Centaurs/SDO  -Rt0 ignores
  all objects between TrneLo and TrneHi.

- init_ephe_path() 

- Reduce compiler warnings

- add switch -YN obj name  and -YNL obj name which set name of object szObjName and
  riyal unnumbered name variable riyalObjName

  example (assuming 305 is slightly lower than constant RiyaHi in astrolog.h ) :
  aastrolog -YNL 305 1994TA -YN 305 1994TA -R0 305 -NB
  would cause it to look for an .sx1 file named
  sx1994TA.sx1  

  This way custom unnumbered objects can be read in.

- aastrolog -YTI -ZC writes double floats instead of integers 
  Then scale=0 in the header. Header remains 3 integers for now
  Needs twice the diskspace 
  Used first for .sx1 files of Voyager and Pioneer spacecrafts

- At beginning or end of .sx1 file use linear approx instead of Everett polynomial
  to extend slightly range of ephemeris. 

- -EY numberofyears -X will actually draw multi-year ephemeris graphics

- switch -YTd value to force deltaT in seconds, e.g. -YTd 0 means deltaT == 0
  Display does not show it however (except -b1)
  Useful for comparing dates given in ET (ephemeris time) or similar 
  Also works with -i -o . TT now means same as ET, no longer same as DT

- use GNU auto tools

- use FileOpen in riyal.c, added mode 3 in io.c

- Loading asteroid names is slow when only .sx1 file present. (searching for .se1 files
  before checking seasnam.txt ). 

- changes in SzZodiac and SzAltitude with -NB switch

- roughly account for lighttime in FRiyalNumbered() and FRiyalUnnumbered()

April 2009
- fix bug with -g -X -Xs 400 for midpoints with text (due to larger grid-> )

- use also libtool for building (shared) libswe

- include swetest and swemini executables

- Upgrade to swisseph-1.76.00

- -yr checks for -F switch on return object and turns it off otherwise, so
  -F Sun Sag 0 -yr initial Sun
  (or combined with -ZE) looks for next return of forced value 

- ChartReturn() calls it ingress instead of return if -F used

- -F allows value of -360 to "unforce" , e.g.
  -F Sun Ari -360 
   will undo previous -F command.

- ChartReturnSet() iterates for more precision

- fix bug printing chart title with -ys -X causing "Bad draw." error

- fixing bugs with -ZEO switch, more occultations in close proximity in time found

May 2009

- use FileOpen instead of fopen for atlas

July 2009

- Bug creating bitmaps was introduced by misplaced added parantheses in extern.h for reduced compiler warnings, corrected. 

August 2009

- edited configure.in

- whole sign aspect switch -Yaw added , also for aspects in declination, not for 3D aspects

January 2010

- replace 2007OR10 (now numbered as 225088) with 2008ST291 in riyal.c

- add new numbered TNO 225088 and 229762, sx files recalculated with epoch MJD 55200

February 2010

- changes in astrolog.h Makefile.am and configure.in for better handling of X11/MOUSE
  configure --without-x and --x-includes etc. should work

- raise version to 0.2

- add house system with SWE houses (-YTF) 
   -c 18 Krusinksi-Pisa -c 19 Gauquelin Sectors -c 7 Morinus
    
- -l -ys0 inputfile promissor significator
  shows primary direction mundo (-ys1 zodiac, -ys2 diurnal arc)

- added switch -ps for with or without 2nd motion of promissor

- added switch -pa angle 
  for angle added to significator (to do aspect in primary directions).May be negative

- converse date with -ZEb

- internal:
  FPlacalcHouses(jd,fFalse) as FPlacalcHouses(jd) before
  FPlacalcHouses(jd,fTrue) fills in sector positions/house position of a planet using swe_house_pos (as only gauqelin sector before)

- added switch  -pm0 mundo,-pm1 zodiac,-pm2 diurnal arc,-pm3 with refraction (if -YTF),-pm4 diurnal arc disk edge,-pm5 with refraction (if -YTF)

- -l -tp2 now shows primary direction list
   ** so far uncertain about precise values without SWE -YTH , non-placidus houses **

- -l -dp2 shows promissor mundane evolution (and primary directions to cusps)
   ** so far only with -YTH **
   ** very slow and misses some **

- -l -Tp2 shows current orb between mundane positions

- correction for -c 7 Morinus and -c 16 houses, Ascendant not 1st cusp,M.C. not 10th

- if -ps switch on, show mundane positions instead of zodiac in -l sector chart
  (with and without graphics)

- for performance either matrix or swe/sx1 positions are used with -b 
  (Previously matrix positions were overwritten by swe)

- Switch for primary direction keys
   -pdp        =Placidus
   -pdn        =Naibod
   -pdc        =Cardan
   -pds        =Solar Arc in R.A.
   -pdb        =Solar Arc in R.A.   on Birthday +-1 day (mean speed)
   -pdv        =Solar Arc Birth Rate in R.A. ("true speed",varies daily in topocentric) 
   The Setting of -pd days/year should be left at default 365.24218967
   -pdp will also reset the default to this value.

- Hardcoded Asteroids only with -D ASTEROIDS defined

March 2010

- Bug for charts in October fixed.
  Rebuild internal handling of JD.
  Quantitative Handling of Seconds in Time
  Quantitative Handling of Seconds in Location

- -sr adds SEFLG_EQUATORIAL in FPlacalcPlanet
  That case no more ecl-equ transform in calc.c needed
  ** check for problems with that in other places **

- include Makemake,Altjira,Haumea,Teharonhiawako,Borasisi in harcoded asteroids

- -RC now means only cusps, -RF is like -RC before 

- -RO means Jupiter to Pluto, -RI Mercury to Mars, -RL Sun and moon, -Rx Asc Desc M.C I.C

- -Ru now means the 79 most important fixstars, -RU means long >1000 star list (if -NL in aastrolog) if applicable

- -Yns shows also lunar south node (instead of mean apogee) even with SWE -b

- added switch -Nk to skip hardcoded asteroids when loading range
  e.g. -Re1 -NA 1 10    vs. -Re1 -NAk 1 10
  This was once on by default , but later disabled, now selectable

- remove swiss ephemeris documentation from distributed .tgz file
  See www.astro.com for documentation

- rebuild centaurs.fle tnpsdo.fle asteroid.fle and adapt riyal.c
  Were mostly using outdated orbits, also bug found with asteroid.fle  
  Remove 2002VQ94 (comet), 1996PW (gone missing)

- version 0.3 started

- expand number of -Ry objects 

- Those will only be read if not ignored, speeds up aastrolog if only few or none selected

- add function swe_sx_nod_aps that will use .sx1 files if no .se1 available
  for (osculating) node calculations (in new file riyal2.c)

- update local OrbFit copy for fitobs.x cartesian element propag output >100AU

- -ZC ConvertSolex if 32bit limitation , error and abort instead of warning

- clean up Restrict Clean, when multiple choices, check for distance instead of hardcoded dates

- again quantitative Handling of Seconds in Time
        quantitative Handling of Seconds in Location

- changes with Atlas request, will also look for altitude (3rd number in line), hopefully
  will work with atlas.txt generated from GNS data as before

- changed (global) atlas.txt file (converted from Solex GEOSITES.DAT, rounded to minfrom 1/100 deg) with some more entries (22611 instead of 2490)  and altitude. 

April 2010

- changes with altitude in io.c RParseSz

- update seasnam.txt , created section named and tno

- fix bug with -zL switch (mode 1 instead of 2 for FileOpen)

- fix bug concerning overwriting obj position with -Nn obj
  Now in calc.c nodes are calculated before object position
  
- updated .fle files with MJD55000

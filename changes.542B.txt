Changes in 5.42A (20 Dec 2001)

 5.42A is on basis of 5.41f instead of 5.41
 51 numbered Centaurs,Asteroids and Transplutonians were added and

 Also a few switches have been added.
 -YTC for topocentric positions   -YTR for true positions
 -za to set altitude -qc to read chart input with altitude 
 -Rh etc. to restrict hypothetical Transuranians
 -td to start listing from a day other than the 1st
 -T takes time as 4th argument
 -Ts sums influences per object -RS restricts for that. The formula is still like in older astrolog versions
 -Ti takes file for transit date & location
 -pt progresses natal during transit listing  

 There is also a switch added -Tc which is to be used together with -Ys for
 long transit influence listings suitable for plotting data input.
 There is also a new switch -pt to compute transits to the progressed chart.

 Use -dp to see what is happening progressed to progressed 
    -t ..,-Tc ..                      transit to natal
    -pt -t.. ,-pt -Tc ..              transit to progressed
    -tp ,-Tp                          progressed to natal 
    -d -zy ..                         transit to transit (mundane)

Changes in 5.42B (5 Jan 2002)

 - completed use of altitude
 - -d displays seconds
 - 30 more asteroids
 - Sorted asteroids by categories
 - New switches
  -Rc etc. restricts Centaurs/Scattered disk objects
  -Rt etc. restricts Transneptunians
  -Ra etc. restricts Atens
  -Rm etc. restricts Amors
  -Rp etc. restricts Apollons
  -Ro etc. restricts other asteroids

 - New keyboard switches in X mode

  1 switches Atens
  2 switches Apollos
  3 switches Amors
  4 switches Centaurs/SDO
  5 switches Transneptunians
  6 switches other asteroids
  7 switches Hypothetical Uranians
  8 switches Lunar objects
  u will switch all of them
    
  C will also switch other terran points besides Cusps (like Coascendant) 

 - Parsing of Objects: First 3,5 or 7 letters are compared depending on
  how much were given
  For example -R0 Apo matches Apogee, -R0 Apoll matches Apollo ,
   -R0 Apollon matches Apollon

 - Bug with added time argument -T corrected: -Tt has 4 arguments, -T only 3 without Time.

 - Interpretation code changed, consider asteroids where first character of interpretation text
  is a letter, i.e. it is not empty. Consider ASC and MC because there is a interpretation text.
  Do not interpret stars.

 - Some short draft interpretations for asteroids added

 - Added switch -YTH for Swiss Ephemeris House Calculations
  Is recommended to turn it on because otherwise Coascendant(M. Munkasey) etc. is not calculated
  However not all Housesystems are done so turn it off for those
  Available : -c 0 1 3 5 6 8 9
  Also Vertex and Equatorial Ascendant "East Point" are calculated here.
  It is not used automatically for progressed charts so far.
 
 - Asteroids that have unknown positions in the past due to close encounters
  are ignored before that date (example Chiron before 650AD)
  Same was not yet done forward in time.

 - Changed colors for different group of asteroids, reactivate hyp.Uranian glyphs.



 INSTALLATION HINTS:

 Edit astrolog.h to set your DEFAULT_DIR and EPHE_DIR

 Your chart files, astrolog.dat and fixstars.ast should  be put into DEFAULT_DIR set in astrolog.h

 The asteroid ephemeris files listed below are needed (download at www.astro.com or with large file)
 and have to be installed under EPHE_DIR set in astrolog.h

 These cover mostly 1500AD-2100AD with some exceptions if the positions are uncertain
 due to close encounters. The files without s after the
 number cover 3000BC to 3000AD.

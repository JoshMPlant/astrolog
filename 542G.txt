- changed date format -E

- Precision improved/Calculation errors removed with unnumbered objects (-YTL)

- Precision improved for -sr (use timedependent epsilon instead of rAxis)

- changes for -a -sr -YSp (coordinates already equatorial)

- -pn -X can be recast unchanged

- Changes for -Tp

- Unnumbered Ephemeris update, added CA249,CB249

- Naming of Ixion and Chaos

- Corrections with -w

- DST per default

- Changes with -N, Speeds and Distance of Nodes, -sr is observed

- Added again unnumbered asteroids AB229,HE46,QF6,CE10,PW96

- Added indication of Max,Min,0+,0- Declination with -d -YSp

- No return indicated with parallel aspects -YSp in -t listing.

- Allow aspects between cusps in -t 

- Updated observated deltat 1997-2002 in swephlib.c

- Ignore unnumbered in 2018-2020 AD

- Changes to interpretation,rulership,default influences

- Date is not set to now for -yt etc. switch
  so astrolog -qd 12 12 2012 -yt file -X shows transits to file for 12.Dec 2012 instead of now
  The transit date has to be set before -yt, otherwise the natal chart is changed
  However with default astrolog.dat,   astrolog -yt file -X still shows transits for now.

- Added missing element for -RP default (used with -yp for example)

- Improvement with Atlas request

  -zL0 Paris -1       shows list of hits on stdout
  -zL0 Paris 5         selects 5th entry
  -zL Paris           selects first found
  -zL0 'Paris ' 2        selects 2nd entry with space after s

- Ignore Lunar node/apogee in heliocentric mode

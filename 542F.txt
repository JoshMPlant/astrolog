- Fixed bug with -j -Ns listing if restricted

- Give Cusps some pseudo speed (365.25) so that app/sep aspects are correct

- Improvements with atlas request -zL.

  btw you can parse GNS data files freely available on the web for some country to the needed format with this 
  little perl script:
  perl -e 'use POSIX ; while (<>) {next unless /^\S+\s+\S+\s+\S+\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+).+\s\s\s\s[A-Za-z][A-Za-z][A-Za-z]+\t([ A-Za-z]+)\t/ && print $3,"              \t\t",floor(0.005+100*(($1-floor($1))*0.6+floor($1)))/100," ",floor(0.005+100*(($2-floor($2))*0.6+floor($2)))/100,"E\n"}' countryfile.txt >> atlas.txt

  URL http://164.214.2.59/gns/html/cntry_files.html
  These data have 1arcminute rounding.

  These are not included with the release because the complete file would be too large.

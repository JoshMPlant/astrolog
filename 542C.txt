
Changes in 5.42C (15 Jan 2002)

- adapted interpretations

- added switch -YTF to consider refraction at the horizon ,with variable arcsize of sun disc for sunrise 
  swe_rise_trans is not used.

- added switch -zp to set pressure in millibar for refraction (-Z -YTF)

- added switch -zT to set temperature in C for refraction (-Zd -YTF)

- corrected problem with -Td and -t switch

- added switch -N[mbadf] for planetary/asteroid nodes,aphelions and 2nd elliptic focal points
  Aspect Orbs etc. is controlled like for Arabic Parts ( -YPo -YPa -YPs)
  The nodes/apogee/aphels is i guess from various approximations/see Swisseph docs and slightly
  different from ephemeris values for lunar node/apogee used in the normal object list.
  b: barycentric (beyond Jupiter) m mean (Merc-Neptune) d desc./Perihel a Aphel/Perihel
  f: 2nd focal points default: nodes,osculating,ascending/aphel

- started switch -ZE[sl] for next solar/lunar eclipse

- Orbs are printed on commandline and internally calculated with at least integer arcseconds
  Window is still only arcminutes

- Seconds are handled hopefully correctly in Chart Time and Longitude/Latitude( -qc)
  and displayed on commandline charts if -b0 (Seconds) is set.
  You can even try to enter 1/10 seconds but replace the " with the number
  e.g. 09:43:427 and 47:22'237 (instead of 47:22'23.7")
  because the " and ' is converted to a 0 and only the ' is backtracked.
  They are also used with -o / -i.

- SWE houses are also used for progressed charts with -YTH,by calculating ARMC for that purpose

- corrected topocentric positions : use only for object center earth even if flag set

- added/removed #ifdef PLACALC so that it compiles and works without SWE. Flags have to be set correctly though 

- added 11 more main-belt asteroids and 9 muses. 
  Added section Muses with Switch -RM etc and keyboard toggle 7.

- added switch -Nn objname to replace East Point,Fortune - Coascendant with nodes&apsides of objname

- added keyboardswitch / \ to go up/down the objname/catalog nr.  as if switched with -Na/Nn in window

- added keyboardswitch 'w' for main objects. Stopped overlap between R and C, now R goes
  only until Apogee, C after Vertex, Cusps, and before Centaurs.
  It is now possible to clear and rebuild the X chart with keys 1-9,u,U,R,w

- Print current focus objname at end of Chart Window for orientation

- added switch -Na numberedasteroid which will put Asteroid # in place of Vertex
  and grab name from ephemeris file (e.g. 2001 KX76 instead of KX76)

- added switches -NN and -NA <startnr> to read in extra asteroids as found in the ephemeris path,starting
  from 1 or startnr.
  Names will be set automatically at startup, may take some time especially 
  if there are gaps. You can read in less to improve performance by reducing cObj in astrolog.h
  if you do not have enough asteroid ephemeris files.
  Hardwired Asteroids are defined in variable skip[] and are skipped.
  Year numbers are stripped from unnamed objects, not if flag -Ny is set.

- added compile option #define ASTEROIDS in astrolog.h so that it compiles without the asteroids

- These are not yet handled in interpretations. Has to be configured by user afterwards if needed.Example:

  astrolog -Na 28978 -R0 2001 -I -YI 2001 Cyclone
  2001 KX76 in Sagittarius and 3rd House: This person's Cyclone is very jovial,
  open minded, loves freedom, and seeks meaning and new experience. Most often
  this manifests in the area of life dealing with communicating to and
  receiving from the environment.

  The N1 has to come first so that the name "2001 KX76" is defined
  All the hardwired asteroids don't have the 2001 etc. because it is bad for identifying
  them by name. So only this one user defined asteroid (with -N1) has it.


- Note that the large file with asteroid ephemeris does not contain ephemeris for the main
  planets , so if you do not install them seperately you will have reduced precision
  for those. These are available at www.astro.com, Swiss Ephemeris

either execute using GNU build environment

tar xvfz astrolog542j-0.1.tgz
cd astrolog5.42j-0.1
configure
make install

For single user 
configure --prefix=$HOME
is recommended so that additional data
can be used without administrator privileges

Historic makefiles for various systems are also still supplied

Ephemeris files must be copied into  $(datadir)/astrolog542j/ephe as well
Also fixstars.ast atlas.txt ,seasnam.txt , seorbel.txt, 

*.fle,*.sx1 into exteph etc...

edit local.h (created by the Makefile) for different setup

SWE Asteroids may go into appropiate subdirectory
e.g. se00005s.se1 into $datadir/astrolog/ephe/ast0
e.g. se32007s.se1 into $datadir/astrolog/ephe/ast32 etc.

Personal chart files can be stored in $datadir , otherwise the path
must be given with -i option or environment variable SE_EPHE_PATH,ASTROLOG,ASTR542J
being set to provide paths to files.

Use #define PC on windows console for \paths , in cygwin bash it is not necessary

Recommended compiler is gcc-4 or gcc-3, freely available at http://www.cygwin.com 

For a version without graphics and printing comment
#define WIN 
#define GRAPH
#define PS

If you want to compile on dos, #define ASTEROIDS will never work.
You can try to use
#define DOS
but this is not tested
and you will probably get memory allocation problems.

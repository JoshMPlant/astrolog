The release of the Swiss Ephemeris source code.
It has currently been tested on Linux and Windows 2003.
A simple Makefile to create a Unix library is included.
The unix-readable of the doc directory are also included.
The release number is sometimes changing frequently when we are in an
active development phase.
Sometimes several releases will be available at the same time.
It is usually best to take the one with the highest release number.

Release 1.61 was the last one which contained 16-bit support.
It is permanently archived in subdirectory sweph161.

Release 1.67 was the last with the old IAU precission model 1976
(Lieske), old nutation model 1980 (Wahr). It is preserved
in swe_unix_src_1.67.tar.gz and sweph_1.67.zip
